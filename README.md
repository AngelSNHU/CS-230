What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Answer: I find for what I did well on developing the documentation was being aware of the design constraints and following the clients design requirements. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Answer: When working with a design document what made it very helpful for developing code was the instructions and requirements being clear throughout the whole process, of what was necessary. It worked as a sort of efficient guideline throughout the development of the whole code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Answer: As for one of the aspects I would like to revise in my documents would be even better research. Finding more research and citations for the overall documents I think could have done a great help overall.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Answer: In a broad sense when looking at user’s needs and effectively implementing them into software design, what is important is keeping the users needs at the back of your mind. Being aware of the users needs allowed me to keep in mind to safeguard those needs throughout the project and satisfy them.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Answer: In terms of how I approached designing software, I was always keeping a clear goal in mind and setting to achieve said goal. Taking the project at weekly basis increments of particular goals made the project overall less daunting and I believe that is what allowed me to complete this project efficiently. Had I not broken down the main goal of this project into subsequent goals; it would have made this project much more intimidating.
